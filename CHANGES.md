# Changes

## 3.1.4: copyright line
- README and THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES name the copyright holder. The license is unchanged (GPL-3.0-or-later).
  No program changes.

## 3.1.3: a phone coming back from the server is seen at once
- **A phone that moves from the server to the mesh reaches the server straight away.** Before, the bridge ignored
  every mesh report from a phone whose server position it had put on the mesh in the last 10 minutes, so a phone
  that walked back into mesh range after using cellular was invisible to the server for up to 10 minutes, and got no
  server -> mesh DMs. The bridge now recognises its copies of server reports by the phone's UID and the report's
  time: a copy coming back (from this deck or another deck on the mesh) is still never sent up, a phone's new report
  is. Reports without a time stamp use the old rule.
- README: a phone connected to the server directly gets its DMs from the server, not through the deck.
- New test `echo_test.py` (real bridge, fake server, phones and a second deck on the mesh); it fails on 3.1.2.

## 3.1.2: the wizard always finds a new deck
- **Ops shows "THIS DECK ISN'T SET UP YET" with a SET UP THIS DECK button** on every refresh until the TAK server is
  set up. Found on the first fresh-user install: opening Ops from the icon showed the dashboard, not the wizard.
- The check that opens the wizard now runs before Ops draws its panels, so an error in a panel can't stop it.
- "Skip" in the wizard only lasts until the browser is closed. 3.1 and 3.1.1 kept it for good in the browser,
  so a wipe of the deck didn't clear it; 3.1.2 erases that old setting.

## 3.1.1: certificate paths with ~ work
- **The bridge now expands `~` in the certificate paths** (`PYTAK_TLS_CLIENT_CERT`, `_KEY`, `_CAFILE`). PyTAK opens
  them exactly as written, so `~/certs/deck.pem`, the form shown in deck.ini.example and the README, made the bridge
  stop at start with "Resource not found", while `meshtoc check` (which does expand `~`) said the files were fine.
  Found by the first real fresh-user install with the setup wizard. The wizard now also writes full paths.
- A test now starts the real bridge with `~/` certificate paths and checks it connects to a TLS server with the
  deck's certificate. It fails on 3.1.

## 3.1: the setup wizard
- **Set up a new deck from the screen, no terminal.** On a deck whose TAK server isn't set up yet, Ops opens
  **TAK MESH TOC // SETUP**: check the deck, choose the OpenTAKServer data package, pick the mesh port, callsign,
  team and role, choose features, get the server helper for DMs, then save and restart.
  - **The data package is handled for you:** zips inside zips are opened, the certificates are converted to the PEM
    files the bridge reads (with the system's openssl), and the server address is read from the package.
  - **The password is asked only if needed:** the one in the package is used when it carries one.
  - **Test connection** uses the deck's certificate exactly the way the bridge will. It says when the server's
    certificate doesn't list the address you use (the usual case over Tailscale) and turns the name check off for
    you. It also catches a server that refuses this deck's certificate.
  - **Nothing is written until the last step**, which shows every deck.ini line it will change. deck.ini keeps all
    its comments, and the old one is kept as `deck.ini.before-setup-<time>`. Certificates go to `~/certs` (folder
    700, files 600).
  - **Restarts the services itself** where the user can use sudo without a password (the default on Raspberry Pi
    OS); otherwise it shows `meshtoc restart`. Then it runs the full check.
  - **Only the deck's own screen can open it**, like the restart button. The package size is capped, zip bombs are
    refused, and nothing from the zip is written to disk under its own name.
- **Run setup again** any time from Ops' SETUP dialog. SKIP TO OPS leaves the wizard.
- README: the wizard first; setup by hand stays, now noting OpenTAKServer's zip inside a zip.

## 3.0.3: clearer first-time setup, tidier code
- **A new deck shows one TODO, not three failures.** Until the TAK server is set up, `meshtoc check` shows one
  `[TODO] TAK server` line saying exactly what to set in deck.ini, and ends with "One thing left to set up". Ops'
  SETUP page shows one amber "TAK server not set up yet" item. The bridge is shown as waiting, not failed. Once the
  server is set up, the normal checks come back.
- **Ops reports problems with its own files.** If it can't read or write its event log or trend history, it says
  so once in its service log (`journalctl -u manet-dashboard`) instead of nothing. It still never stops over it.
- **A guard test for the two PyTAK patches** (big server events, a closed connection, socket tuning, the outbox),
  so a PyTAK upgrade that breaks them fails the tests instead of failing in the field.
- **Code tidy-up:** shorter file headers and class notes, old names and version labels out of comments, two
  out-of-date comments corrected, one helper instead of three copies.

## 3.0.2: honest delivery, safer outbox, bounded memory, tests that run anywhere
From two outside reviews (Gemini and ChatGPT) of 3.0.1.
- **Chats on their way to the server are synced to disk** (fsync) before they are sent, and the outbox file is
  replaced safely when it is tidied up, so a power cut can't lose them. If the disk write ever fails, the chat is
  still sent and Ops shows **NOT SAVED TO DISK** with the reason.
- **Delivery is reported honestly.** A chat counts as confirmed only when the server answers a later ping. If pings
  are off, or the server never answers them, Ops says chats are **sent, not confirmed** instead of treating
  "written" as delivered.
- **Memory stays bounded under a flood of made-up UIDs** (a buggy app or a hostile device): the bridge's per-phone
  tables stop at 10,000, phones already talking keep their place, and the cleanup runs at most once a second
  (before, it re-scanned the whole table on every packet once it passed 4,096). Chat's on-net list stops at 2,000.
- **Every service has a memory ceiling** (`MemoryMax=400M`): if one ever leaks, only that one restarts. It needs
  the kernel's memory accounting; where that is off, systemd ignores it.
- **Chat now uses the bundled takproto**, the same copy as the bridge. Before, it only decoded TAK Protocol
  (protobuf) mesh packets if takproto happened to be installed on the computer, so on a deck without it the
  **On net** list missed phones that send their positions in protobuf. Found by running the tests on a clean computer.
- **Tests run on a clean computer.** Tests that load the bridge's code now use the bundled PyTAK, takproto and
  protobuf (not copies installed on the computer, which can be different versions), run with `python3 -S` so that
  can't come back, no longer need BeautifulSoup, and make their own temporary folders.

## 3.0.1: more than one mesh node
- **Ops no longer tracks just one node.** `NODE_IP` can list several nodes (`NODE_NAME` gives their names in the
  same order), and when it is blank Ops finds the nodes on the mesh port by itself (the gateway, the DHCP server and the
  neighbours that serve a settings page). The mesh link is OK when any node answers; MESH + DECK lists each node, marks
  the nearest (fastest) one, and shows a node that went quiet as "not answering" in amber.
- **Mesh traffic counts.** If no node answers a ping but mesh traffic arrived in the last minute, the Mesh tile stays
  LINK OK (amber, TRAFFIC ONLY) and TAK BRIDGE keeps RELAYING. NODE LOST, and DEGRADED on the bridge, now mean no
  pings and no traffic. Before, moving the cable to another node showed NODE LOST and DEGRADED while the bridge was
  working fine.
- The event log notes each node going quiet or coming back, and the mesh link as a whole being lost or back.

## 3.0: TAK MESH TOC
- **New name: TAK MESH TOC**, a portable TAK operations center for a mesh network. It was MANET_MESH_BRIDGE.
  - The pages say **TAK MESH TOC // OPS** (the dashboard), **TAK MESH TOC // CHAT** and the VOICE page, with new icons in
    the same slate and steel-blue look: a mesh with a command post in the middle for Ops, a chat bubble of mesh nodes
    for Chat. The desktop icons are **TAK MESH TOC Ops** and **TAK MESH TOC Chat**.
  - The command is now **`meshtoc`** (`meshtoc check`, `meshtoc restart`, ...). `manet_mesh_bridge` still works.
  - The package is `TAK_MESH_TOC_v<version>.zip`. `meshtoc tidy` tidies old packages under either name.
  - Deck Chat is now **TAK MESH TOC Chat**: in ATAK's device info the deck's chat shows as "TAK MESH TOC Chat", and the bridge
    as "TAK MESH TOC".
- **Nothing to redo on an installed deck:** the folder (`~/manet_mesh_bridge`), `deck.ini`, the services
  (`manet-bridge`, `manet-chat`, `manet-dashboard`, `manet-voice`), voice settings and the Mumble pin all stay. The
  installer adds the `meshtoc` command and renames the desktop icons.

## 2.2.3: polish
- **Code comments:** version tags like "1.0.7:" and "used to..." removed from the code (that history lives here in
  CHANGES); old file names (`bridge.ini`, `dashboard.ini`, `deck_chat.ini`) replaced with the sections of `deck.ini`.
- **Pages:** Deck Chat's tooltips and help say "server" instead of "server/family"; the dashboard's alert and control
  notes point at `[dashboard]` in `deck.ini`.
- **Defaults:** Deck Chat and the dashboard read `~/manet_mesh_bridge/deck.ini` when started without `--config`
  (the services always pass it, so installed decks are unchanged).
- **One stylesheet per page:** the dashboard's and Deck Chat's styles were the old green look with the pro look layered
  on top. They are now merged into one stylesheet each (about a third shorter), with the theme layer, the glow
  variable and the last bunny styles gone. Checked element by element in a browser at several screen sizes: every
  page looks the same as before. The dashboard's status feed calls the bridge state `activity` instead of `bunny`.
- **Status colours back:** the dashboard's SETUP button turns amber or red when setup has problems, and in Deck
  Chat a QUEUED message's tick is amber and a HELD one red. (The pro look had turned both grey by accident.)
- **README:** a "who uses what" table for voice, the install example no longer names an old version, the test
  counts and needs are current.

## 2.2.2: tidy
- `tests/voice_test.py`: when run as root, the lab Mumble server runs as the user who called sudo (or `nobody`),
  instead of a fixed user name.
- A demo-data comment in the dashboard reworded. No change to what any program does.

## 2.2.1: voice docs, from real use
- **README, Voice:** how server-side ATAK phones use VX. They join the talk group's **Mumble** channel over
  Tailscale (a multicast talk group never crosses Tailscale). VX only trusts a Mumble server that uses the
  OpenTAKServer certificate; with Mumble's own certificate it says "missing or incompatible certificate". The README
  now has the commands to give Mumble the OTS certificate, and says to re-pin on the deck afterwards. Tested on a
  real server: VX on a server-side Android talks with the mesh through the deck.
- **README:** the Mumble config path on current packages is `/etc/mumble/mumble-server.ini`.
- No program changes.

## 2.2: voice, and one look
- **Voice (new, optional, off by default):** the `manet-voice` service carries OpenMANET's push-to-talk talk groups to
  Mumble channels on your server and back. ATAK phones on the mesh (VX plugin) and Mumble users (iPhone, PC) talk to
  each other. A one-talk-group prototype was field-tested on two OpenMANET nodes with VX phones and an
  iPhone on Mumble; this multi-talk-group version is lab-tested against a real Mumble server.
  - One talker per talk group, a "Channel busy" message for a Mumble user who talks over the mesh, a 60 s limit on a
    stuck transmit, no echo, no backlog.
  - TG1 is bridged by default; TG2–TG5 each have a **BRIDGE TO MUMBLE** switch on the VOICE page, linking to the
    Mumble channel of the same name. Remembered across restarts. Several talk groups can be bridged at once.
  - **LISTEN ON DECK:** play one talk group through the deck's speaker, with volume and a level meter.
  - Listening and the switches work on the deck's own screen only; from other devices the page is read-only.
  - Mumble over Tailscale with the server password and a pinned certificate. `check` prints the fingerprint to pin.
  - Standard library plus the system's libopus. Our own small Mumble client; no pip packages.
  - Accepts the VX plugin's Opus, which it labels RTP payload type 0.
- **Deck Chat has a VOICE page** (a tab next to CHAT): talk groups, who is talking, who is on each one (mesh and
  Mumble), recent transmissions, LISTEN ON DECK and the bridge switches. The VOICE tab shows a dot while someone is
  talking.
- **Dashboard:** a voice row in MESH + DECK (who is talking, or clear / Mumble down).
- **One look: pro.** The green and amber looks, the look button, `/night` `/green` `/pro` and `THEME` are gone. The
  bunny is gone too, and with it the dashboard's animation timer that redrew it 20 times a second, all day: less CPU
  and heat on the deck. A leftover `THEME` line is harmless; `check` says it can be deleted.
- **Installer:** installs `manet-voice` (it stays stopped while `VOICE = off`), opens UDP 38801-38810 on eth0 if UFW
  is on, and says if libopus is missing. `uninstall.sh` removes both.
- **The bridge** writes the mesh phones' IP addresses to its status file, so the VOICE page shows callsigns, not IPs.
- **Tests:** new `voice_test.py` (62 checks against a real Mumble server: audio both ways per talk group, two talk
  groups at once, busy floor, stuck transmit, VX payload type, certificate pinning, wrong password, server restart,
  listening on the deck, the bridge switches, the VOICE page in a browser, the `check` lines). `theme_test.py` is now
  `look_test.py` (60 checks, including the VOICE page and deck-screen-only controls).

## 2.1.1: dashboard fix
- **Fixed:** in a window shorter than full screen, the dashboard squeezed MESH + DECK down to a few pixels, so it could
  not be seen or scrolled (both looks, worst in pro). The server link and mesh + deck panels now share the column and
  each scrolls inside, and a very short window scrolls the whole page instead. Full screen on the deck looks the same.
- **Tests:** `theme_test.py` checks both looks at four window sizes (44 checks); the new checks fail on 2.1.

## 2.1 "TAK MESH BRIDGE PRO": the pro look
- **A third look, `pro`,** for the dashboard and Deck Chat: slate background, no glow, condensed headings, data in a
  fixed-width font, green only for "ok", steel blue for what is selected. Same information, same controls.
  - Dashboard: the bunny makes way for a large msg/min number.
  - Deck Chat: the roster moves to the left; messages carry a MESH or SERVER tag.
- **`THEME` in `[deck]`** (`green`, `amber` or `pro`) sets the look every screen opens in. The page's button (now
  GREEN / NIGHT / PRO) changes it for one browser. An unknown value opens green, and `check` warns about it.
- **Fonts bundled** in `common/fonts/` (SIL Open Font License), so the pro look needs no internet.
- **Tests:** new `tests/theme_test.py` (36 checks, including the classic look staying unchanged).

## 2.0: iTAK support, from real use
- **mesh_mailroute 2.1:** each mesh phone also gets a mail rule for its device ID. iTAK addresses DMs by device ID
  (ATAK uses callsigns), so with helper 2.0 iTAK's DMs to mesh phones were dropped at the server. Tested with an iTAK-style
  DM; helper 2.0 fails that test.
- **The deck has a team by default:** the example config sets `TEAM = Cyan` and `ROLE = HQ`. iTAK only lists the deck
  as a person you can message when it has a team. `manet_mesh_bridge check` warns when none is set.
- **README:** a new "iTAK (iPhone) users" section covers four things:
  - the deck's team
  - reconnecting after a callsign change (the server keeps the first name it saw)
  - device-ID DMs
  - logins for video in iTAK's stream entry, with how to read MediaMTX's "invalid SETUP path"

## 1.0.10: first public release
**MANET_MESH_BRIDGE** began as a private bridge for one deck, developed and field-tested through versions 1.0 to
1.0.9. This first public release is that code, cleaned up for anyone to install.

**Fixed**
- **Startup freeze:** a bridge started with more than 99 chats waiting in the outbox froze at startup (1.0.9). The
  outbox is now replayed once the sender is running.
- **Repeated chats:** a server that never answers pings no longer gets the same chats again on every restart.

**Installing and running**
- **Installs offline.** PyTAK 7.6.1, takproto 3.0.1 and protobuf 6.33.6 are bundled in `vendor/`.
  - The bridge runs with `python3 -S`, which uses only those libraries, never other copies installed on the computer.
    Mixing versions was found to break imports.
- **New names:** the command `manet_mesh_bridge`, the folder `~/manet_mesh_bridge`, and the services `manet-bridge`,
  `manet-chat` and `manet-dashboard`, grouped by `manet_mesh_bridge.target`.
- **`manet_mesh_bridge check` checks more:** the bundled libraries, the certificate files and their permissions
  (with `.p12` conversion help), the server link round trip, the clock and the hardware watchdog.
- **The installer:**
  - re-checks that the bundled libraries load
  - notes other programs already using the deck's ports
  - repairs missing services or a missing command, instead of saying "nothing to do"

**Configuration**
- No personal defaults:
  - **Server:** comes from `COT_URL` only.
  - **Mesh node:** `NODE_IP`, or else the gateway on the mesh port.
  - **Example config:** written for a new user.
- **New defaults:** `RETURN_PATH = 1`, and `DM_RELAY = 0` until the server helper is installed.

**Project files**
- **Server helper:** `server/mesh_mailroute` (version 2.0) is included. It refuses to run without the deck's UID,
  instead of guessing it.
- **License:** GPL-3.0-or-later, with third-party notices.

**Tests**
- New: `tests/privacy_test.py` and `tests/install_sim.sh`.

## Before 1.0.10 (private versions, summarized)
- **1.0.9:**
  - DM route check: a test message every minute through the server helper.
  - Outbox: chats and DMs are kept until the server has confirmed them, and resent after a lost link.
- **1.0.8:**
  - The mesh packet check accepts what OpenTAKServer accepts. Padding and junk are cut off, and multi-event packets
    are split.
  - The bridge refuses an untested PyTAK version.
- **1.0.7:** server-only mode, and switching by itself when a mesh node is plugged in.
- **1.0.6:**
  - A forgiving `deck.ini`: a setting written twice, a Windows BOM, `%` in values.
  - Malformed mesh packets are dropped at the deck.
- **1.0.5:**
  - The server link watchdog (pings and reconnects).
  - Uplink priority, with the newest position per phone.
  - A fair return path.
  - Server link rows on the dashboard.
- **1.0.4:** hardening found by fuzzing:
  - regex limits
  - server events over 64 KB
  - Deck Chat input checks
  - a GPS reader that survives bad data
- **1.0 to 1.0.3:**
  - One package with one config file, replacing three separate programs.
  - Read-only releases and rollback.
  - DMs across the bridge, GPS position, and Deck Chat.
